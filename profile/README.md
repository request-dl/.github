# RequestDL

Hello, welcome to RequestDL.

This is an organization on Github that houses repositories maintained by our team. In addition, you can visit our repositories at:

**SwiftNIO**

- [RequestDL](https://www.github.com/request-dl/request-dl-nio)
- [OpenAPIRequestDL](https://www.github.com/request-dl/swift-openapi-request-dl-nio)

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/request-dl) and in each repository through the README.md file.

## Our Objective

Our goal is to simplify and streamline the networking layer coding process by leveraging the declarative programming paradigm. The smoothness that SwiftUI brings to app implementation has inspired us to create RequestDL.

We are constantly implementing new features, exploring what the community is currently using, and following international standards that define the functionality of HTTP resources.

Moreover, we greatly value your contribution to making RequestDL even better. Feel free to open an issue, discuss an idea, implement a new feature, or simply have a chat with the community.

## Platforms

Currently, RequestDL is supported on all Apple platforms and Linux.

We are interested in expanding RequestDL to other platforms supported by Swift. We would love your contribution to take RequestDL even further.

## Why the Tucano bird?

The Request library, initially developed by Carson Katri in 2019, served as the foundation for RequestDL. However, in 2020, Brenno de Moura made contributions that eventually led to the point (2022) where he requested permission from Carson to continue the work independently, focusing on developing new features.

RequestDL originated in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, and as a tribute to the country, the Tucano bird, which is a common symbol found in Brazilian brands, was chosen as its mascot. Embracing the advancements in technology in 2023, the artwork for RequestDL was created using the text-to-image generator feature of the Canvas software.
