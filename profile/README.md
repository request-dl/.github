# RequestDL

Hello, welcome to RequestDL.

This is an organization on Github that houses repositories maintained by our team. In addition, you can visit our main repository at [RequestDL](https://github.com/request-dl/request-dl).

## Documentation

Documentation is available in each repository both through Github Pages and the README.md file.

## Our Objective

Our goal is to simplify and streamline the networking layer coding process by leveraging the declarative programming paradigm. The smoothness that SwiftUI brings to app implementation has inspired us to create RequestDL.

We are constantly implementing new features, exploring what the community is currently using, and following international standards that define the functionality of HTTP resources.

Moreover, we greatly value your contribution to making RequestDL even better. Feel free to open an issue, discuss an idea, implement a new feature, or simply have a chat with the community.

## Platforms

Currently, RequestDL is supported on all Apple platforms and Linux.

We are interested in expanding RequestDL to other platforms supported by Swift. We would love your contribution to take RequestDL even further.
